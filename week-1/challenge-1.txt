Description

This challenge is to write a program that displays LCD-style numbers at adjustable sizes.

The digits to be displayed will be passed as an argument to the program. Size should be controlled with the command-line option -s followed by a positive integer. The default value for -s is 2.

For example, if your program is called with this:

lcd 012345
The correct display is screenshot #1.

And for this:

lcd -s 1 6789
The correct display is screenshot #2.

Note the single column of space between digits in both examples. For other values of -s, simply lengthen the - and | bars.

Good luck ! ;)
