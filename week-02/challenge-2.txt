Given a file containing one word per line (file: wordlist.txt uploaded to this issue), print out all the combinations of words that are anagrams; each line in the output should contain a set of input words that are anagrams of each other. No word should appear in the output more than once.

The correct result to find based on the wordlist.txt file is: 5629 anagrams.

For added programming pleasure, find the longest words that are anagrams, and the set of anagrams containing the most words.

Have fun !! :-)
